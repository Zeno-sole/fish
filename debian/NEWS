  fish 3 is a major release, which introduces some breaking changes
  alongside improved functionality. Although most existing scripts will

fish (1.22.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Much has changed since the last major upstream release.  It is recommended
  that all old shells be exited after upgrading.  It is a known problem that
  ctrl-d will not exit any shells that were running before the upgrade because
  function definitions for key-bindings changed in a backwards-incompatible
  way in 1.22.X.  Simply use the 'exit' command.

  Fish has changed where it looks for config files both in the system-wide
  directories and in the user's home directory.  Upon first starting this
  version of fish, it will attempt to migrate the user's config files to the
  new directory structure as well as display a message notifying the user.
  The changes are as follows:

  System-wide:
  /etc/fish.d -> /etc/fish
  /etc/fish -> /etc/fish/config.fish
  /etc/fish_inputrc -> /etc/fish/fish_inputrc
  /etc/fish.d/fish_interactive.fish -> /usr/share/fish/config_interactive.fish

  Per-user:
  Fish's config files now live under $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME
  defaults to $HOME/.config).
  $HOME/.fish -> $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/config.fish
  $HOME/.fish_history -> $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/fish_history
  $HOME/.fish_inputrc -> $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/fish_inputrc

fish (1.21.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Fish's completion and function files have been moved from
  /etc/fish.d/{completions,functions} to
  /usr/share/fish{completions,functions}.  Fish will still source files under
  /etc/fish.d{completions,functions} in order to allow the sysadmin a means of
  overriding the default completions/functions.

  If any of these files have been modified, they will be saved under
  /etc/fish.d as {completions,functions}_$filename.dpkg-bak.
